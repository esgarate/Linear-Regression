# Linear-Regression

We download a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars.
Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, evaluate your model using test set, 
and finally use model to predict unknown value.

Linear Regression fits a linear model with coefficients  𝜃=(𝜃1,...,𝜃𝑛)  to minimize the 'residual sum of squares' 
between the independent x in the dataset, and the dependent y by the linear approximation.
